.. note::
   This package has moved to https://github.com/uchchwhash/maths.
   Not that it had anything worth moving here anyway.
   But the name conflicts with that of the very promising project
   https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Core.
   Maybe some day I'll have enough time to put this thing together.
